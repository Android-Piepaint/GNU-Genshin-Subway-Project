## About
This map is built in Minecraft 1.19.4 using [GNU/Genshin OS](https://gnugenshin.miraheze.org/wiki/GNU/Genshin/en).<br>
On July 28, 2015, The GNU/Genshin Project was formed. It is worth noting that a famous Minecraft Map called "Republic of FlashTeens", was also formed on that day.<br>
The project was initially called "The FTMC OS", is a Linux-Based operating system for x86 devices. Just like other Linux-Based embedded system softwares, it doesn't have its own package manager because it is designed only for subway managements. <br>
